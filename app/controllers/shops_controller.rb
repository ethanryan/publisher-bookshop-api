#Endpoint 1
#  for a specific Publisher it should return the list of shops selling at least one book of that publisher.
# NOTE: publisher.shops accomplishes this...

#  Shops should be ordered by the number of books sold.
# NOTE: assuming books_sold_count means a particular publisher's sold books...

#  Each shop should include the list of Publisherâ€™s books that are currently in stock.
