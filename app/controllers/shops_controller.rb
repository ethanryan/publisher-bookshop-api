#Endpoint 1:
# publisher_shops -> /publishers/:publisher_id/shops
#  for a specific Publisher it should return the list of shops selling at least one book of that publisher.
# NOTE: publisher.shops accomplishes this...

#  Shops should be ordered by the number of books sold.
# NOTE: .order("books_sold_count DESC") above accomplishes this, books_sold_count is a shop's total sold books, not a particular publisher's...

#  Each shop should include the list of Publisherâ€™s books that are currently in stock.
# NOTE: conditionally rendering this in shop_serializer
